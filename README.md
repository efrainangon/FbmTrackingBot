# FbmTrackingBot
These are old versions of pieces to an Amazon FBA and FBM bot that automates various processes on the Amazon Seller Central platform. I sell this, so I have to choose code snippets to show my skills while protecting my business! Anything marked as omitted is omitted for these reasons. Reach out to me directly if interested in viewing the CURRENT version of this project and the omitted code.
